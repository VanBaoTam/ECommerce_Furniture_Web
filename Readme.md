Project about Furniture ecommerce using HTML CSS JS PHP (No frameworks).

! OPEN SOURCE !
! THIS IS A PROJECT THAT I DID FOR EXCERCISE !

Requirements:

- WAMP
- DB: Mysql - Dump file (in database's folder)
- Web browser that supports JS Engine v8
- ...
  How to run:
- Firstly, move this project into www dir in WAMP folder
- Import db dump file into mysql
- Run WAMP
- visit the URL on your web browser: "localhost/(project's folder name)/"

Core features:

- Ready-to-run project
- Good simple UI and responsive
- Authentication and Authorization are added
- Full management rights on Product
- No need to download anything else except WAMP to make this run

Limitations and missing features:

- Base on a specific description that I got from teacher, this project missed a lot of features that must be had nowadays.
- This project is built base on 2 side model: web-application <-> DB
- Lacking some security techniques currently (only have SQL injection and deep validation).
- Not having account's profile management features.
